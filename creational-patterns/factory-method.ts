/** Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,

// Use cases:
// When you need common interface for multiple implementations
// When you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
// When you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.
// When you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.
